            <h2>1. Calorie Surplus: The Foundation of Bulking</h2>
            <p>
                To gain muscle, you need to consume more calories than your body burns. 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How Much to Eat:</strong> Start with a 10–15% calorie surplus above your maintenance level and adjust as needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Track Progress:</strong> Aim for a steady weight gain of 0.5–1 pound per week.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>2. Macronutrient Balance: The Building Blocks of Growth</h2>
            <p>
                Balance your protein, carbs, and fats effectively: 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protein:</strong> 1.6–2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight daily. Sources: Chicken, fish, tofu, eggs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbs:</strong> 4–6 grams per kilogram of body weight. Sources: Oats, rice, quinoa, fruits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fats:</strong> 0.8–1 gram per kilogram of body weight. Sources: Avocado, nuts, olive oil.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>3. Meal Timing: Optimize Your Energy and Recovery</h2>
            <p>
                Plan meals strategically:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Workout:</strong> Carbs and protein 1–2 hours before exercise (e.g., oatmeal with whey protein).</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-Workout:</strong> Protein and carbs to replenish glycogen (e.g., a protein shake with a banana).</li>
                    <li><strong>Throughout the Day:</strong> Eat 4–6 smaller meals for stable energy.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>4. Supplements: Enhancing Your Nutrition Plan</h2>
            <p>
                Consider these supplements:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protein Powder:</strong> For meeting daily protein goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creatine:</strong> Supports strength and muscle growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mass Gainers:</strong> High-calorie options for extra nutrients.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>5. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
            <p>
                Avoid these pitfalls:
                <ul>
                    <li>Skipping vegetables—essential for vitamins and minerals.</li>
                    <li>Relying on junk food—choose clean, whole foods.</li>
                    <li>Ignoring hydration—drink plenty of water daily.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
